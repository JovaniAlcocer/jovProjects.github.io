								With the given data, I first filled in the blank columns, such as the customer’s name, email and country, using the <strong>XLOOKUP</strong> function in Excel. While one may use the XLOOKUP formula to fill out the missing columns, I used a different function to fill columns I to L, by using the <strong> INDEX </strong> and <strong> MATCH </strong>functions. After filling out the missing columns with data from the other sheets, I then constructed new columns so that the viewer may better understand the terms being used to classify the different coffee types,size by using <strong> IF</strong> formulas. I then created a <strong>TABLE</strong> with the data I had worked on, and then I constructed <strong> PIVOT TABLES</strong> to make <strong> PIVOT CHARTS/GRAPH</strong>. With the data we were given, we formed graphs showing the most impactful stories, like different coffee types, sales over time(years) and more. Using <strong>SLICERS</strong> , we can visually see the impact certain qualities (for example country) has on the sales of coffee.

				<p> The Excel Project is located on Youtube, where the goal is to construct an interactive dashboard so that we can visually see the impact certain factors have on the sales of coffee. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>In Excel </strong> we used a given data set containing various information from customers from a bike shop. In the project, I first cleaned up the data set using tools such as <strong>find and replace</strong> and more, to make the data more readable for the viewer.
							Afterword, I constructed a few <strong>pivot tables</strong> and a <strong>pivot chart</strong> to visually show the key details of bike consumers, and at the end I created a dashboard with a <strong>slicer</strong> to see how data such as a customer’s age purchasing a bike gets impacted by factors such as education, region or marital status.

			<strong>During this course,</strong> we had assignments where we needed to compute(c++) the desired output, using a specific technique/method. We learned how to use for loops, lists, arrays and more. We learned to use libraries for vector,queue,stacks and more.
								We also learned that we can present our code in a better manner by using headfiles, and many more tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			<p><strong>Project 1</strong> Using the given <strong>header and function files </strong>for a stack, I was instructed to create a file that asks the user for inputs(capital letter) on the color of candies they received, and then consider the fact that a sibling takes all the yellow (Y) candies, and the output will be a stack without the Y while implementing the functions constructed in the header file.   </p>

						<p><strong>Project 2</strong> Using the stack and queue libraries in <strong> c++ </strong>, I was instructed to create a program that asks the user for a word, and store it in a string, and then decide if the word is a palindrome or not. Having knowledge of the properties of a stack and a queue is crucial in this assignment, since using the functions such as <strong> top.()  </strong> and <strong> front.()  </strong> behaves differently, as we store the string into a stack and a queue.

		<h1 class="major"> MAT 450 Wave Equation Project</h1>
		<span class="image fit"><img src="in460.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>  The purpose of the project was to create a poster on a partial differential equation and use numeral methods to solve a problem of one's choosing. 


		</p>
		<p>
			
			Focusing on the Wave Equation, I was to create a poster including the model, numerical methods, and an analytical problem where I was to use python to solve the problem using numerical methods. The main purpose of the course was how one can rely on numerical methods when solving complex ODE/PDE, and how we can transfer these formulas like Euler and Runge-Kutta into code(python) by using libraries like Numply and Matplotlib.

		<p>   
			During the course we wrote many proofs on questions based on theorems we covered in the course. 
			


		</p>
		<p>
			For the final, we were to compile our best work and write a portfolio including the best proofs for the main subjects covered in the course. With the techniques covered, we were to explain the theorems first, and then answer the question using methods like contradiction, etc. Key point was to thoroughly explain each portion since the purpose for writing this paper was so that even if someone were to read the paper, they would understand the key points.
